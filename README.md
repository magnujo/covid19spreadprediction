# covid19
My bachelor project about how to make Covid19 simulations. Made together with Andreas Dafnopulos Hansen. This is only a representation of the code. The code was originally made in Kaggle, and can be executed and forked from there: https://www.kaggle.com/andyyh/covid-19-in-denmark-and-the-world. The project report can be found here: https://rucforsk.ruc.dk/ws/files/68122634/Simulering_af_covid_19_I_danmark_med_python.pdf
